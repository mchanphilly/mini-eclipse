For my IAP 2023 Mini-Eclipse project for MIT ProjX

I designed and built a 2D cable robot using C++ on Arduino to control a window shade that moves with the Sun. I also wrote a modest parser and scheduler to issue commands to the system. Before building, I simulated the system using Python.


* `py` includes the Python simulation code.
* `eclipse` includes the C++ for the Arduino.
